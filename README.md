# meh-AH!
meh-AH is the IPA phonetic transcription of the Hebrew word for the number 100.
With the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, Israel's Ministry of Health issued emergency instructions, among which is the prohibition of leaving home for a distance of more than 100 meters, if not for the resupplying of food and medication.
In light of this situation I have built an app that can help people measure the distance from home, and get an alert when ecceeding that distance.
