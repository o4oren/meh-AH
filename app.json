    "description": "meh-AH is the IPA phonetic transcription of the Hebrew word for the number 100. With the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, Israel's Ministry of Health issued emergency instructions, among which is the prohibition of leaving home for a distance of more than 100 meters, if not for the resupplying of food and medication. In light of this situation I have built an app that can help people measure the distance from home, and get an alert when ecceeding that distance.",
